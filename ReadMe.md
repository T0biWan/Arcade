# Arcade
A collection of 2D-Games made with:
- HTML5
- JavaScript
- Phaser
- Foundation

## Server
Browserbased Games require to run on a Server. For this purpose I use node.js and express.js to write a simple server.
Also useful is the very minimalistic []http-server] ()https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

Serverstart with Terminal from within /Arcade
```
- node: node Server.js ../Arcade
- http-server: http-server ../Arcade
```
